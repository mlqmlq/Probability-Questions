1. 52 cards randomly distributed to 4 players with each player 13 cards. What is the probability that each of them having an ace?

2. A basketball player take 100 throws. She scored on her first throw, and miss the second. For each of the following throw, the probability of scoring is the fraction of her successful throw so far. For example, if she scored 23 points after 40 throws, the probability of her next throw is successful is 23/40. After 100 throws, what is the probability that she scores exactly 50?

3. A gambler starts with *i* dollars. On each game, he win $1 with probability *p*. He will stop if he accumulate *N* coins or loses all his money. What is the probability that he end up with *N* dollars?

4. You are taking candies one by one out of a jar with 10 red, 20 blue and 30 green candies. What is the probability that there are at least 1 blue and 1 green candies left when you take out all the red candies?

5. There is one amoeba in a pond. After every minute, it may die, stay the same, split into two, or split into three with equal probability. What is the probability that eventually the amoeba specie will die out?

6. In a primitive society, every family perfers a girl. Hence, they will keep having babies until they get one girl. What will eventually happen to the fraction of girls in this society?

7. You have five envelopes A-E and five cover letters A-E. You randomly put the cover letters into the envelopes. What is the probability that all the cover letters go into the wrong envelope?

8. *N* points are drawn randomly from the circumference of a circle. What is the probability that all of them are in a semi-circle?

9. What is the expected number of cards that need to be turned over in a regular 52 card deck in order to see the first Ace?

10. *N* distinct types of coupons in boxes and each type independent of prior selections, is equally likely to be in a box.

* How many coupons on average are needed to make such a complete set?

* If I collected *n* coupons, what is the expectation of distinct coupon types?

Randomly draw *N* straight lines over a circle so that the circle is cut into *m* pieces. What is the expectation of *m*?
