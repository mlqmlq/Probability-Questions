1. 52 cards randomly distributed to 4 players with each player 13 cards. What is the probability that each of them having an ace?

2. A basketball player take 100 throws. She scored on her first throw, and miss the second. For each of the following throw, the probability of scoring is the fraction of her successful throw so far. For example, if she scored 23 points after 40 throws, the probability of her next throw is successful is 23/40. After 100 throws, what is the probability that she scores exactly 50?

3. A gambler starts with *i* dollars. On each game, he win $1 with probability *p*. He will stop if he accumulate *N* coins or loses all his money. What is the probability that he end up with *N* dollars?

4. You are taking candies one by one out of a jar with 10 red, 20 blue and 30 green candies. What is the probability that there are at least 1 blue and 1 green candies left when you take out all the red candies?

5. There is one amoeba in a pond. After every minute, it may die, stay the same, split into two, or split into three with equal probability. What is the probability that eventually the amoeba specie will die out?

6. In a primitive society, every family perfers a girl. Hence, they will keep having babies until they get one girl. What will eventually happen to the fraction of girls in this society?

7. You have five envelopes A-E and five cover letters A-E. You randomly put the cover letters into the envelopes. What is the probability that all the cover letters go into the wrong envelope?

8. *N* points are drawn randomly from the circumference of a circle. What is the probability that all of them are in a semi-circle?

9. What is the expected number of cards that need to be turned over in a regular 52 card deck in order to see the first Ace?

10. *N* distinct types of coupons in boxes and each type independent of prior selections, is equally likely to be in a box.

* How many coupons on average are needed to make such a complete set?

* If I collected *n* coupons, what is the expectation of distinct coupon types?

11. 500 ants are randomly put on a 1 foot string with uniform distribution. Each ant randomly moves toward one end of the string (equal probability) at a constant speed 1 foot/min until it falls off the string. When two ants collide heads on, they will both change directions. What is the expected time for all ants fall off the string?

12. Two players bet on rolls of the total of two 6 face dice. Player A bets a sum of 12 comes first and player B bets two consecutive 7s will occur first. They keep rolling until one of them wins. What is the probability of A wins?

13. Keep flipping a fair coin until you get either *HHH* or *THH*. What is the probability that you end up with *HHH*?

14. Keep flipping a fair coin until you get either *TTH* or *HTT*. What is the probability that you end up with *TTH*?

1. Randomly draw *N* straight lines over a circle so that the circle is cut into *m* pieces. What is the expectation of *m*?

2. Suppose a matrix satisfies <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\mathbf&space;A^3&space;=&space;\mathbf&space;O" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\mathbf&space;A^3&space;=&space;\mathbf&space;O" title="\mathbf A^3 = \mathbf O" /></a>. What is the maximum rank of that matrix?

3. Randomly draw one sample from <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\mathcal&space;N(0,\sigma^2)" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\mathcal&space;N(0,\sigma^2)" title="\mathcal N(0,\sigma^2)" /></a> with unknown variance. What is the point estimate and confidence interval of the variance?

4. Person A has a 20-sided dice and person B has three 6-sided dice. They both roll their dice and whoever gets a bigger number/sum of numbers wins the game. Is it a fair game? Same game with one more player C who has a 20-sided dice. Is this new game fair? (all dice are fair; a 20-sided dice has number 1,2,…, 20 on each of its 20 sides)

5. What is the upper bound for the determinant of the correlation matrix?

6. There is a fully connected graph with each edge has a weight *w*, i.i.d generated from an unknown distribution *F*. A pair *(a, b)* is called a good pair if their edge weight *w_{ab}* is the largest for all edges of *a* and *b*. What is the expected number of good pairs when there are *n* vertices?

7. Throw 10 dice in a row. What is the probability that their sum is divisible by 6?

8. Keep throwing a 6-sided dice until we get a 6. What is the expected number of tosses given the condition that all numbers in this trial is even? *(This is a very tricky question)*

9. *X* = sum{100 dice}, *Y* = sum{600 coin tosses}. What is P(X>Y)?

10. Keep generating numbers from *U[0,1]* until the number you see is smaller than the previous number. What is the expected number of tosses?

11. Suppose the height of people on the street are iid. In expectation what is the number of people sampled to observe a person's height higher than the first one?
